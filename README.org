** .gitconfig

If using a GPG key, do not simply create a link to the ~.gitconfig~ file in this
repository. Instead, create a ~.gitconfig~ file in the local home directory with
the following contents:

#+BEGIN_SRC
[include]
    path = dotfiles/.gitconfig
[user]
	signingkey =
#+END_SRC

inserting the long form of the GPG key ID you'd like to use.
